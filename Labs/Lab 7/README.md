# Lab 7 ThingSpeak and Google Sheets

*I pledge my honor I have abided by the Stevens Honor System - Nicholas Scirocco*

## Reviewing and Running ThingSpeak

I first logged into the Mathworks account and created new channels called cpu_loop with fields for cpu_pc and mem_avail_mb.

## Google Sheets

I first created a new project called cpudata on the Google Cloud Platform IAM. 

I enabled the Google Drive and Google Sheets API for this project. 

Then I created a service account key and saved the json file containing this information.
